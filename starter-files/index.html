			   	<p>All my characters are me. I'm not a good enough actor to become a character. I hear about actors who become the role and I think 'I wonder what that feels like'. Because for me, they're all me. I relate to these characters because aspects of their personality are like me. And I just turn up the parts of myself that are them and turn down the parts that aren't. Not to discriminate against budgets, I feel that independent films tend to ask more questions and don't pretend to know as much as the bigger films, which tend to think they know everything. I think the one thing I love most about being an adult is the right to buy candy whenever and wherever I want.</p>

			   	<p>I could be fun, if you want. I could be pensive, uhh... smart, supersticious, brave? And I, uhh, I can be light on my feet. I could be whatever you want. You just tell me what you want, and I'm gonna be that for you. I'm really not good at knowing what people want, because don't have that talent. If ever I try to predict, I'm sure I will be instantly humbled. I try not to make to many movies. I get sick of myself, so I can imagine how everyone else feels. I fantasized about robbing banks for a long time, ever since I was a kid</p>
